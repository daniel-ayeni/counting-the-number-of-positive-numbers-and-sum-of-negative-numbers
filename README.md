To count the number of positive numbers and find the sum of negative numbers in a list of numbers using Python, you can use a for loop to iterate over the elements of the list, and use if statements to check the sign of each number.

the count_positives_sum_negatives function takes a list of numbers as input, and uses an if statement to check if the input is an empty array or is null. If it is, the function returns an empty array. If the input is a valid list, the function uses a for loop to iterate over the elements of the list, and uses if statements to check the sign of each number, incrementing a counter for the count of positive numbers and adding negative numbers to a sum. The function returns an array with the count of positive numbers and the sum of negative numbers.
