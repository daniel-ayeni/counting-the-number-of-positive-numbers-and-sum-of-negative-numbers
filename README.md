To count the number of positive numbers and find the sum of negative numbers in a list of numbers using Python, you can use a for loop to iterate over the elements of the list, and use if statements to check the sign of each number.
the count_positives_sum_negatives function takes a list of numbers as input, and uses a for loop to iterate over the elements of the list. 

It uses if statements to check the sign of each number, and increments a counter for the count of positive numbers and adds negative numbers to a sum. The function returns a tuple with the count of positive numbers and the sum of negative numbers.

You can adapt this approach to perform other calculations on the elements of the list, such as finding the average, the maximum, or the minimum value.
